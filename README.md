# AI-Projects

In this repository, you will find all the AI Projects I developed using Python.

## Crossword AI
  Developed an AI to solve a crossword puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
  
## Nim AI
  Developed an AI to play the game Nim. The AI will always choose the best move possible. 
  The AI was trained to play Nim by playing a set number of games against itself. 
  
## Tic-Tac-Toe AI
  Developed an AI to never lose at Tic-Tac-Toe. Using the minimax algorithm, the AI will always choose the best move that maximizes its chances of winning.
  
## PageRank Algorithm
Implemented Google's PageRank algorithm on a small sample of web pages. 

## Minesweeper AI
Implemented an AI to play Minesweeper. If there are safe moves to play, the AI will choose one of them to play. Otherwise, the AI will play a random move. The AI uses the knowledge it obtained from the current cells on the board to determine which cells are safe and which cells contain bombs.

## AI Traffic Sign Detector
Built a neural network using TensorFlow to classify thousands of traffic sign images into 43 categories

## Degrees 
Found the shortest path between 2 actors by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them. To find the shortest sequence of movies that connect both actors, a breadth-first search algorithm was implemented. Similarily, a depth-first search algorithm was also implemented to find the shortest path

## Heredity 
Developed an AI to calculate the probability a person will have a certain genetic trait based on the probability that the parents have the gene and the probability of the trait.

## Knights 
Developed an AI to solve simple logic puzzles.

## Parser 
Utilized the NLTK Python library to develop an AI to parse a sentence and extract the nouns from the sentence.

## Questions 
Developed an AI to answer questions by retreiving the most relevant sentences from some text it analyzed before. Utilized the NLTK Python library to parse sentences. 

## Shopping
Developed an AI to analyze thousands of online shopping purchases and predict whether a future online customer will complete an online purchase. Utilized the scikit-learn library to develop and train an AI model to make predicitions off of the data.
